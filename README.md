# AdvertisingSalesPredictor
The application is designed to predict sales based on the number of advertisements across different media types using a linear regression model. It leverages an ASP.NET MVC 6 frontend to collect user input and a Flask backend to handle predictions.



This project demonstrates how to integrate a linear regression model with a web application using ASP.NET MVC 6 and Flask. The application predicts sales based on advertisement spending across different media types.

Performance Metrics:

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 1.645
R² Score on Training Data: 0.896
R² Score on Test Data: 0.899
